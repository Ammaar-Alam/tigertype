        "This class definitely put me in my lowest lows, a lot of sobbing in JRR bathrooms and I considered dropping/PDFing it multiple times. In fact, countless people did end up dropping it. Everyday I questioned why I didn't follow suit.",
        "This was when mental illness took a hold of me. Each assignment after was a similar fight for my life. I still do not think I know what a raytracer is or rasterizer despite spending a decade coding them. The only thing I knew was pain. I wanted to explore the intersection between visual arts and programming, and the only thing I need to explore now is therapy.",
        "The assignment states that \"In this assignment you will create a simple 3D modeling program,\" yet it is nothing but \"simple\". It is perhaps \"simple\" to Alan Turing or an extremely experienced programmer but I am not a natural-born computer scientist. I did not come out of the womb coding JavaScript. My first words as a child were \"mom\", and not \"Hello World\" . So why and who thought it was brilliant to exponentially increase the difficulty to this significant level?",
        "After five weeks of partaking in this course, I had to contact my psychiatric provider to prescribe me anti-depressants. This is because this course perpetuated my mental illness, with each assignment spurring new bouts of depression. Whenever I think I reached a new low, this course gave me a shovel and commanded me to dig deeper.",
        "However, one heavenly force shielded me from the pain: Claire Gmachl. A goddess among us. Mother Teresa, or perhaps even God, reincarnated into a Princetonian.",
        "Dr. Martinez mentioned she gets motion sickness very easily, so it's a miracle she can still teach this course given how fast we move between concepts and how quickly each exam comes up.",
        "On the first day of lecture, I walked into McCosh 10, opened my laptop, and started playing coolmathgames.com. Let me tell you that when Vreeland started speaking, I had to PUT DOWN Papa's Pizzeria and listen to the eloquent stream of creativity this man constructed.",
        "Like, if you want to learn how to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, this is your class. If you want to bike home as the birdies sing every Friday dawn, this is your class. If you want to cry while reading the St. Crispin's day speech as the 9AM classes start to trickle in, this class is for you.",
        "I have been giving this class my all. Body and soul. Sinew and stone. Of my own flesh have I made an offering. 80% of this term's allotted nightmares/stress dreams. Easily 70% of my homework time. But, I mean, now that I'm at the end, I feel kinda... forged. I am hot steel, about to plunge into the ice bucket of winter break. It has made a man out of me.",
        "This class was the definition of masochism. As an alternative, try (1) playing a Knife Game with a cleaver, (2) chewing cactus, (3) drinking boiling water, (4) ordering \"Indian Spicy\" at a local Indian joint, (5) waterboarding yourself in the Public Policy school fountain, (6) driving with your feet across a mine field, (7) juggling hatchets whose handles were dipped in flaming oil, (9) walking barefoot on needles, (10) force‑pulling your teeth out with pliers and no anesthesia, (11) playing Marco Polo with a bear, (12) running through campus naked in the middle of winter, or (13) wiping your hand across a splintered board repeatedly.",
        "Imagine this: you get a toddler, give them a book on differential equations that has 70% of its pages ripped, and ask them to find the wave function of a Hydrogen atom using Schrodinger's equation (without any guidance). This is EXACTLY how the assignments felt. They are torture devices intended for you to end up questioning your entire education and supposed intelligence.",

His paws moved slower, his eyes growing dimmer with each passing minute. I knew that he was pushing himself too far, but I couldn't stop him. The code grew more complex, a twisted labyrinth of logic and mathematics.",
        "Max, the reincarnation of Helen Keller, had pushed the boundaries of coding too far. He had tried to defy the laws of computer science, and it had cost him his life. As I held Max's lifeless body, I knew that I would never forget the lessons he had taught me. He had shown me the power of coding, the limitless possibilities of the digital realm. And he had paid the ultimate price for his ambition. I buried Max in the backyard, surrounded by the code that had consumed him.",

        "If you need to fulfill your systems requirement, don't take this course. If you're just looking for another cos class, don't take this course. If you're standing on the edge of a cliff and can either jump or take this course, I'd tell you to jump. STAY AWAY.",

        "Integrated Science Curriculum? More like I Scream and Cry (everyday, everynight over this class).",

        "If that isn't enough, literal billionaires come to speak to this class.",
        "So procrastination is actually a good option.",
        "This class is absolutely awful. The guy doesn't speak English. I have literally never once in my 15 years of formal education been in the presence of a teacher so atrocious.",
        "In the sleepy afternoon light of McCosh 50 with the shades drawn and the brightest thing in the room being the screen of the wrestler in front of me's subway surfer emulator (Lord knows it isn't the professor), one cannot help but fall asleep as he mumbles into the microphone unintelligible sounds that masquerade as English words on statistical tests and methods.",
        "This level of incompetence at conveying the material is simply unprecedented in Princeton; nay Ivy League; nay university; nay pedagogical history, since the dawn of mankind.",
