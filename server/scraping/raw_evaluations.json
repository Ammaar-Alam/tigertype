Honestly one of my favorite COS classes at Princeton -- Dondero's amazing, the experience of actually building an entire app from start to finish front to back is really rewarding, and the class gives you a lot of transferable skills for the real world. However, it can really be a time suck. I was tweaking like every other week because of the tight deadlines and milestones, and its hard to fit like tens of hours of debugging (or more!) into your schedule. still a great class and i don't regret taking it. just maybe don't do it in a five-course semester or with another high workload class",

You can tell that he TRULY cares about his students and wants them to succeed. I have emailed/posted on Ed before asking questions when I need help and Professor Dondero is so quick to respond. He never makes it feel like you are bothering him by asking questions. He is so generous with his students and it truly makes a difference. You feel supported as a student every step of the way and it makes the learning experience that much better.  My only advice would be to truly give this course your all. It's hard and takes a lot of work (especially with the semester long Project), but you will learn so much and it will feel so rewarding to be a better Software Engineer by the end of the course.",

    "comment_text": "I came into this class with some background in frontend development, so I don't think I learned that much in this class. However, still a decent course and worth taking for the semester-long project! Lots to say, though. First, like most people mention, lectures are mind-numbingly boring, but still mandatory because of attendance with basically iClicker questions but through a website. Mainly it's teaching syntax/tools/frameworks for full stack, a lot of which are outdated now; these lectures could probably be made into YouTube videos and we would watch them on 2x speed / skip around for useful info... Dondero has good volume and speaks quickly though, and the lectures are very organized. But another thing I disliked about lectures was that he taught many MANY versions of code that taught bottom-up, and it becomes a lot to parse through to find the relevant code to help with assignments; it's only ever really the newest versions that are useful. There's only 4 assignments throughout the semester and they are very manageable. They are also partnered, but probably doable independently. Would recommend finding a group of 4 for the semester-long project and then splitting into pairs for the assignments. They say they'll \"expect more\" from groups of 5. Try to find a group before class starts / in the first week. Now for the project... I had learned React over the summer. Dondero really hates React for some reason, and discourages people from learning it because of the learning curve; there is kind of a learning curve, if you have 1-2 people in your group with some experience that's best. But you are allowed to use ChatGPT/Claude for the project, and they're good at React! Also I would say there is not as much support/resources as I would have liked for the project, probably because every project is going to be so different. You have weekly TA meetings, but most of them don't really have much experience in React so they're mainly there to check-in on deliverables. Similarly, it was kind of hard to figure out how to set up the project in terms of code structure; we used Vite + React (also not much support in class for Vite) in frontend and Flask in backend (taught in class). Managing the two server thing was a bit tricky, had to use Vite proxy, and then we deployed as a single server. Also would recommend having everyone use their own branch and use GitHub pull requests to avoid merge conflicts (was not taught in class)! CAS integration was not too bad, but had some help though from someone who had experience. I think more people ended up using jQuery, but in my opinion they should just be teaching React more (it's covered but not a lot) because it's definitely more useful and popular now, also more scalable. Like with React and a lot of project-related issues, Dondero will try to help as much as he can but he might not end up being helpful... As long as you have a good group though, and ask Chat a lot, you'll be fine. Definitely follow the deliverable due dates, if not stay a bit ahead of them. Each project has a self-designated \"team leader\" (which I was), and something that was helpful is to figure out all the tasks for the week and divvy them up. Finally, there is definitely a lot of documentation work during reading period so would really recommend you finish up your code/product work like 2-3 days before the final product is due. Overall, the project is definitely something worthy of putting on your resume, and I'm super grateful for the class to be able to support that kind of project, you don't get a lot of time to work on fun things like that elsewhere!",
